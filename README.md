### README for **The Perfect Question**

The Perfect Question is a journaling reflection assistant designed to encourage deeper thinking. It helps users process emotions, analyse experiences, and plan their actions. The app uses intelligent prompts to provide tailored questions based on what the user has written. This allows users to reflect in ways they may not have considered before.

The app categorises journaling into four distinct stages. These include description, processing, analysis, and planning. Each stage focuses on a specific aspect of reflection, ensuring a structured approach. Users can progress through these stages while receiving prompts that match their thoughts.

The app generates three types of questions for reflection. These are "What if" questions, force thinking questions, and belief questions. "What if" questions expand possibilities and introduce hypothetical scenarios. Force thinking questions push the user to generate ideas quickly. Belief questions probe the roots of personal thoughts and examine influences that shaped them.

For instance, if a user writes about feeling stuck in their career, the app generates reflective questions. An example "What if" question might ask the user to consider switching to a completely new career. A force thinking question could challenge them to list a bold career move they could take within a week. A belief question might explore whether parental expectations or peer comparisons caused their belief about success.

The app integrates OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model to process user input. It analyses text for patterns and matches it with the appropriate journaling stage. Questions are crafted to engage the user and provide insights specific to their experiences.

The project is currently deployed as a static web app. While GitHub Pages is used for hosting, the app can integrate dynamic elements on other platforms. Contributions and feedback are welcome. Please refer to the repository for instructions on setup and usage.
